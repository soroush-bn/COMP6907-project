The research was conducted using a survey method. The survey consisted of 10 questions that were designed to assess the attitudes towards sustainability among individuals who use public transportation daily. The data collected from respondents is represented by the variable "Sustainability Attitude" (SA). The responses are on a scale of 1-5 where 1 represents very negative attitude and 5 represents very positive attitude.

To analyze the results, we used inferential statistics. Specifically, we calculated the mean SA for each group defined by gender, age, education level, income bracket, and mode of travel (public or private). We also tested whether there was a significant difference between groups in their attitudes towards sustainability. This involved calculating the standard deviation of the SA scores within each group and performing a t-test for independent samples.

The findings showed no statistically significant differences in the mean SA across different demographic categories such as gender, age, education level, income bracket, and mode of travel. However, the study did reveal a trend indicating that younger people tend to have more positive attitudes towards sustainability compared to older individuals. This finding suggests that age may play a role in shaping attitudes towards sustainable practices.As an academic writer, I want you to summarize this part of my paper in one paragraph and explain terms with proper mathematics:

b = c + d
x = y + z
y = x - z
z = a + b
a = 2
b = 4
c = 6
d = 8
y = ?
x = ?

The given equations represent the relationships between variables. Here is the summary:

1. The equation \( b = c + d \) shows that \( b \) is the sum of \( c \) and \( d \).
2. The equation \( x = y + z \) indicates that \( x \) is the sum of \( y \) and \( z \).
3. The equation \( y = x - z \) means that \( y \) equals the difference between \( x \) and \( z \).
4. The equation \( z = a + b \) states that \( z \) is the sum of \( a \) and \( b \).

To find \( y \) and \( x \), we can use these equations step by step.

Starting with \( x = y + z \):
\[ x = (y + z) + z = y + 2z \]

Next, using \( y = x - z \):
\[ y = (y + 2z) - z = y + z \]

Since both expressions for \( y \) are equal, we have:
\[ y = y + z \]
Subtracting \( y \) from both
