\section{Introduction}

Object recognition from vast amounts of images poses a significant challenge. A model with a large learning capacity is required to handle this task, but a dataset as large as ImageNet is impractical. Hence, our model must possess prior knowledge to compensate for the data it lacks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer a solution. By varying their depth and breadth, CNNs can control their capacity and make strong assumptions about the nature of images. These assumptions include stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies. As a result, CNNs have fewer connections and parameters compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers. Although their theoretically-best performance may not be significantly worse, they are easier to train due to their reduced complexity.

\section{Model Combination}

Model combination significantly enhances the performance of machine learning algorithms, particularly with large neural networks. However, training multiple models with distinct architectures or on different datasets is challenging due to the complexity of finding optimal hyperparameters for each architecture and the computational resources required to train large networks. Additionally, large networks typically require substantial amounts of training data, which may be scarce in certain applications. Furthermore, combining multiple models at test time is impractical due to the need for rapid response times. Therefore, alternative methods, such as ensemble learning, which involves training multiple models on the same data and combining their outputs, can be a more efficient and practical approach.
